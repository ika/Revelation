It is important to note, right from the beginning, that John's 
revelation is about Jesus the Messiah, not about devils, beasts, 
times or places.

The word ‘Christ’ is Greek and the word ‘Messiah’ is Hebrew. Both 
words mean ‘Anointed One.’

Here we catch a glimpse of how we should understand this 
revelation. It describes ‘things which are’ and ‘things which 
have to take place after this.’ In other words, things that took 
place at the time of its recording, almost two thousand years 
ago, and things that were yet to take place, as seen from the 
perspective of the first century.

The word ‘Paradise’ includes the idea of a garden and an orchard.

A denarius was a day's wage for a labourer

6
The great tribulation, or trouble, is the time between the first 
and second comings of Christ.

7
See chapter 20 for parallel verses.

‘Sorcery’ includes the use of potions and drugs.

Many readers overlook the fact that John speaks of two numbers 
written on people's foreheads.

In the first century they drank wine diluted with water. God's 
wrath will be undiluted.

Rome is built upon seven hills.

12
Here John tells us when this revelation took place. The seven 
kings are seven Roman emperors, five had fallen, which means he 
is writing during the reign of the sixth. Depending on how John 
counted, this would place his writing either under the reign of 
Nero or Galba. Either way, he is writing before the destruction 
of Jerusalem by Titus in the 70A.D.

All prophecy is about Jesus.

This ‘feast’ is described in Ezekiel chapter 39.
